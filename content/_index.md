I am a software engineer based in Switzerland with a background in physics. During the day, I spend most of my time 
writing and reviewing C++ code, with occasional interruptions involving Python. In my free time, I enjoy reading, 
tending to my plants, and exploring areas related to software engineering that are not necessarily part of my daily 
work â€” such as embedded systems, playing around with `nix`, or more generally tinkering with Linux.
